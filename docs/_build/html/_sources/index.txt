Welcome to CouchDB Tools's documentation!
=========================================

This is the documentation for CouchDB Tools. CouchDB Tools is a wrapper for the RESTful
`CouchDB HTTP API <http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/api/index.html/>`_ with the target to offer a convenient and intuitive
way to use the CouchDB API. Simply use the CouchDB API documentation and use it with the wrapper.

NOTE: this is still in early development stage
